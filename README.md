# SuperBAS language package for Atom

**Syntax highlighting for the [SuperBAS](https://github.com/adamsoutar/SuperBAS) programming language, for use with [Atom](https://atom.io/)**

language-superbas isn't on atom.io yet, for now you can install it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamsoutar/atom-language-superbas
cd atom-language-superbas
apm link
```

language-superbas uses the `.sbas` extension by default.
