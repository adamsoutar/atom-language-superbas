# SuperBAS language package for Atom

**Syntax highlighting for the [SuperBAS](https://github.com/adamsoutar/SuperBAS) programming language, for use with [Atom](https://atom.io/)**

language-superbas isn't on atom.io yet, for now you can install it with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamsoutar/atom-language-superbas
cd atom-language-superbas
apm link
```

language-superbas doesn't take over as the grammar for any file types, though '.sbas' is the recommended. For now, you can click the `Plain Text` button in the status bar and select `SuperBAS` to switch the current editor.
